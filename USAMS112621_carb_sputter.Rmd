Load data, blank correct, add consensus values and comparison to consensus

```{r}
# consensus value for druffel coral
dcmean <- 0.9413

raw <- getRawWheel("USAMS112621")

rawsum <- raw %>%
  filter(ok_calc == 1) %>% 
  select(wheel_pos, he12c) %>% 
  group_by(wheel_pos) %>% 
  summarize(he12c = mean(he12c))

wheel <- getWheel("USAMS112621") %>% 
  blank_cor_carb(blanks = c(20,21)) %>% 
  left_join(rawsum, by = "wheel_pos") %>% 
  add_consenus() %>% 
  mutate(rec_num = if_else(wheel_pos == 10, 171988L, rec_num)) %>% # fix labelling error
  mutate(fm_consensus = ifelse(rec_num == 21308, dcmean, fm_consensus),
         fm_diff = fm_corr - fm_consensus,
         sigma = amstools::sigma(fm_corr, fm_consensus, sig_fm_corr))

results <- wheel %>% 
  filter(wheel_pos %in% c(2:11, 13:21)) %>%

```

```{r}

```

```{r}
ggplot(results, aes(fm_corr, fm_diff)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Outliers

Rec 171996 was also HGIS outlier!  HGIS value was 5% high. Maybe a something about the sample?

```{r}
combined_results %>% 
  filter(abs(fm_diff) > 0.02) %>% 
  select(rec_num, sample_name, he12c, fm_diff, fm_corr, sig_fm_corr) %>% 
  arrange(he12c)
```


```{r}
# Remove 171996, which was 5% high for both HGIS and carb sputter
cr_no <- combined_results %>% 
  filter(rec_num != 171996)

mean_diff <- cr_no %>% 
  filter(method == "direct carb") %>% 
  summarise(across(fm_diff, list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))

mean_errs <- cr_no %>% 
  group_by(method) %>% 
  summarise(mean_sig = mean(sig_fm_corr)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = method,
              values_from = mean_sig)

```

## Agreement with graphite

Agreement of Haiti core samples. Graphite samples were pretreated with HCl to leach 30% of the sample. HGIS samples not pretreated.

### Difference plot
